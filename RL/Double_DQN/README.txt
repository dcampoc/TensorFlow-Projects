A double DQN is considered to learn a task in the Taxi-v3
from the OpenAI gym (see https://gym.openai.com/envs/Taxi-v3/)

The code can be trained from scratch by setting the argument new_networks=True
in the Agent instance. The network in 'Example_1.h5' is obtained after 500 episodes
whereas 'Example_1_complete.h5' is obtained after 1000 episodes and already
performs the proposed task correctly.
